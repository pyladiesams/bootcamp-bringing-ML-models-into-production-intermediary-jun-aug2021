# Bringing ML Models into Production Bootcamp
# Lesson 2: Batch Inference

Watch the recording of this lesson [here](https://youtu.be/G1qxR1Hi3i8).

## Goal

The goal of this lesson is to learn more about:
- machine learning lifecycle building blocks in action
- Batch inference on Azure

---
## Exercise 1: Register ML model
### Steps

1. Register the same model via cli
2. Register the same model via Python script by using Model.register method
3. (Optional) Register the same model via Python script by using run.register method

---
## Exercise 2: Attach and remove inference cluster

### Steps

1. Attach an inference cluster via Python script
2. Remove this inference cluster via CLI
3. Optional (Remove this inference cluster via Python script)

---
## Exercise 3: Schedule Azure Machine Learning pipeline

### Steps

1. Schedule the pipeline to run every Wednesday at 08:00 in the morning via Python Script
2. Schedule the pipeline to run every day at 13:00 via Python Script
3. Deactivate the scheduled pipeline via Python Script
4. Optional (Explore other possible steps in the pipeline)

---
## 4. Home assignment

**Goal**

Get hands-on experience with machine learning buidling blocks and batch inference on Azure

1. Open [Ridge model training notebook](ridge_model_training.ipynb) and follow the steps to train Ridge model
2. Evaluate and register trained Ridge model.
3. Follow the steps in Batch inference on Azure to setup and schedule Azure Machine Learning pipeline to run every day.
