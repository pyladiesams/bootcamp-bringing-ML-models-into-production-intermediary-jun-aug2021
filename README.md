# Welcome to Python Bootcamp: **Bringing ML models into production**

## Bootcamp description
It's a 6 week-long [PyLadies Amsterdam](https://amsterdam.pyladies.com/) Python hands-on Bootcamp following a real-life industry scenario (presented by [Dexter](https://dexterenergy.ai/)). Teaser: it’s all about energy :)

After finishing this bootcamp you will know more about:
* machine learning project lifecycle building blocks
* machine learning model deployments scenarios
* how to prepare your machine learning model for deployment
* hands-on with batch and real-time serverless deployments on Azure
* best practices, common mistakes to avoid during the deployment process

In this repository you will find:
* The content to follow our live sessions with home assignments
* Capstone assignment

## Prerequisites

- docker
- bash shell (git bash on Windows, bash on Linux, zsh/bash on Mac)
- Miniconda (or Anaconda)
- Visual Studio Code
- Hands-on Python data science related experience
- Some modeling experience with scikit-learn library is a pre
