# Welcome to Python Bootcamp: **Bringing ML models into production**

## Bootcamp description
It's a 6-week-long [PyLadies Amsterdam](https://amsterdam.pyladies.com/) Python hands-on Bootcamp following a real-life industry scenario (presented by [Dexter](https://dexterenergy.ai/)). Teaser: itâ€™s all about energy :)

After finishing this bootcamp you will know more about:
* machine learning project lifecycle building blocks
* machine learning model deployment scenarios
* how to prepare your machine learning model for deployment
* hands-on with batch and real-time serverless deployments on Azure
* best practices, common mistakes to avoid during the deployment process

In this repository you will find:
* The content to follow our live sessions with home assignments
* Capstone assignment

## Prerequisites
